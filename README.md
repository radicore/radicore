- Hi 🎉! I’m radicore; A chess enthusiast ♟️ and a random, avid programmer in Lua and Python.
- I am currently (althrough I may some day get bored of this), and frustratingly, trying to create a chess bot from scratch in C++.
  - Unfortunately, the project is private, however I may publish it if I deem the project to be a success, and when I find out how ***"magic bitboards"*** work (aka the bane of my life).
  - I have since learned that these magic bitboards initially spark 💖 curiosity before slowly picking off your individual braincells.
  - Don't fall into the loophole of magic bitboards, I am doing it professionally for science of course!
- To add to this wonderful description of me, my name and age is...
